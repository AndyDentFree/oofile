So it would be best to use the existing statics.The current sFileMode settings set up ctree for multiuser or client  or single user and within a given oofile context this is constant.However a user could concievably want to have different conections with differnt tranasction modes, so have decided to set transaction mode through paramter onin dbConnect_ctree methods: 		openConnection			openOrCreateConnection		-added mTransactionMode setting-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-	000414  GUARDING AGAINST INVALID FILE MODES It would be better to check the filemode validity in oof_ctreeBackend buildifil method rather than just tranasction validity in dbConnect_ctreeas we could then guard against invalid file modes as well as invalid tranasction modes, although sFileMode is static and we could check it in the dbConnectthe buildIFIL is lower down the call chain and would catch inadverdant changes to sFileMode.So move validTransactionmode to oof_ctreeBackend and rename to validFileMode. 	-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=--=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-	000414  DEFAULT TRANSACTION MODE Initailly chose trnlog. but this is bad default should be no transaction, as that is the way oofile origonally was.
