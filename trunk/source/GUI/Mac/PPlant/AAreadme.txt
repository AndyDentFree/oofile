AAreadme.txt
-----
It is part of A.D. Software's software engineering standards to
place an AAreadme.txt file in every directory of any importance.
If a file is missing it is to be considered a bug, unless the
directory is covered by a file in a parent directory.

This small note added to explain the .am file. This is an AppMaker project
used to generate the oofYNC dialog. By having an original AppMaker project we 
can regenerate the dialog using whatever are current PPob styles in PowerPlant 
as AppMaker is regularly updated to match.
