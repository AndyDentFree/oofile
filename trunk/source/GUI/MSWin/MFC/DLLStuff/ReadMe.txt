       MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : OOFileGUI_MFC

========================================================================





AppWizard has created this OOFileGUI_MFC DLL for you.  This DLL not only

demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes but

is also a starting point for writing your DLL.



This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that

make up your OOFileGUI_MFC DLL.



OOFileGUI_MFC.cpp

    This is the main DLL source file that contains the definition of

	DllMain().





OOFileGUI_MFC.rc

    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the

    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored

    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft

	Developer Studio.



res\OOFileGUI_MFC.rc2

    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft 

	Developer Studio.  You should place all resources not

	editable by the resource editor in this file.



OOFileGUI_MFC.def

    This file contains information about the DLL that must be

    provided to run with Microsoft Windows.  It defines parameters

    such as the name and description of the DLL.  It also exports

	functions from the DLL.



OOFileGUI_MFC.clw

    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing

    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store

    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data

    maps and to create prototype member functions.

Other standard files:



StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp

    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file

    named OOFileGUI_MFC.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.



Resource.h

    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.

    Microsoft Developer Studio reads and updates this file.
