This directory contains header files that add information designed to be processed by the Doxygen documentation generator.

The sub-directory dotOriginals contains .gv files in the DOT language format, that will be included by Doxygen's dotfile directive and can be rendered indivuidually using GraphViz.

This represents a change from the old OOFILE documentation where one big doxyfile.h contained all of the doxygen comments, other than those scattered copiously across the source.
